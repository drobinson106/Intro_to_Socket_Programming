# Introduction to Socket Programming with Python

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating basic socket programming concepts for building a simple client-server communication system. The scripts included are:

- **`tcp_client.py`**: A basic TCP client that connects to a server and sends a single message.

- **`tcp_client_multiple_messages.py`**: An extended version of the TCP client that sends multiple messages to the server.

- **`tcp_server_multiple_clients.py`**: A TCP server capable of handling multiple client connections concurrently.

- **`tcp_server_reverse.py`**: A TCP server that reverses the incoming messages from clients.

- **`tcp_server_to_uppercase.py`**: A TCP server that converts incoming messages from clients to uppercase.
